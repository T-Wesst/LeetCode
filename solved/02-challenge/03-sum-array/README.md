In this activity, you will write code to create a function that adds up all the numbers in a given array and returns the total.

## Instructions

* In this file, you will write code in the body of the `sumArray` function to achieve the following:

  * Add all of the numbers in the given `arr` array argument and return the total.

    * For example, given the following array:
