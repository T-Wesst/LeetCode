# Countdown

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that prints all whole numbers from `num` to a given number.

## Instructions

* In this file, you will write code in the body of the `countdown` function to achieve the following:

  * Print all numbers from the given `num` argument to `1` inclusive.

    * For example, given the number `10` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

      ```bash
      10
      9
      8
      7
      6
      5
      4
      3
      2
      1
      ```

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
