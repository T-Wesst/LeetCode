# Title Case

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a given string.

## Instructions

- In this file, you will write code in the body of the `titleCase` function to achieve the following:

  - Return a string identical to the given `str` string, but with the first letter of each word capitalized.

  - For example, given the following string:

      ```js
      var str = "a lannister always pays his debts";
      ```

  - The following string should be returned:

      ```js
      "A Lannister Always Pays His Debts";
      ```

- Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

- Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
