# Factorial

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that returns the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a given number.

## Instructions

- In this file, you will write code in the body of the `factorial` function to achieve the following:

  - Return the factorial of the given `num` integer.

  - A factorial of a number is the product of all of all positive integers less than or equal to the number.

  - For example, given the following number:

      ```js
      var num = 3;
      ```

  - The following number should be returned:

      ```js
      6;
      // 1 x 2 x 3 === 6
      ```

  - If given `0`, the factorial should be `1`. Otherwise, assume the given number will be a whole positive number.

- Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

- Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
