# Is Palindrome

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes in a string and determines whether or not it is a palindrome.

> **Note**: A palindrome is defined as any string spelled the same forwards as it is backwards.

## Instructions

- In this file, you will write code in the body of the `isPalindrome` function to achieve the following:

  - Return `true` if the given string is a palindrome.

  - Return `false` if the given string is not a palindrome.

    - For example, given the following string:

        ```js
        var str = "racecar";
        ```

    - The following should be returned:

        ```js
        true;
        ```

- Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

- Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
