# Camel Case

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes a string and returns the string in camel case.

## Instructions

  * In this file, you will write code in the body of the `camelCase` function to achieve the following:

    * Return a camel-case version of the given string.

    * A string is in camel case when there are no spaces between words, the first letters of each word except the first word is capitalized, and all other letters are in lowercase.

    * See the following string for an example:

      ```js
      let str = "let the force flow through you";
      ```

    * Given the preceding example, the following string should be returned:

      ```js
      "letTheForceFlowThroughYou";
      ```

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
